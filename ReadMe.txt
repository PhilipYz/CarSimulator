Assumptions:

Room dimension indexing works similarly to array indexing.
Creating a room with the dimensions (10, 10) means that
the positions are indexed as follows: (0 -> 9, 0 -> 9).

Creating a car at position (5, 5) would place it at
position (5, 5) in the room. Continuing with the earlier
room example, placing a car at position (10, 10)
would mean placing it outside the room.

The user is able to enter an empty set of commands,
essentially running a simulation where nothing happens.
